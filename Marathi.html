        <h2>What is Water Pollution?</h2>
        <p>Water pollution occurs when harmful substances such as chemicals, waste, or toxins contaminate water bodies like rivers, lakes, oceans, and groundwater. This can negatively affect both the environment and human health. Pollution can occur from a variety of sources, including industries, households, agriculture, and even natural causes like storms.</p>

    <!-- Types of Water Pollution Section -->
    <section id="types">
        <h2>Types of Water Pollution</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chemical Pollution:</strong> This occurs when harmful chemicals from industries, factories, and agricultural runoff are discharged into rivers and oceans. These chemicals can poison aquatic life and pollute drinking water.</li>
            <li><strong>Plastic Pollution:</strong> Millions of tons of plastic waste end up in our oceans, rivers, and lakes every year. This type of pollution can choke marine animals and damage fragile ecosystems.</li>
            <li><strong>Oil Spills:</strong> Oil that leaks into the water from ships, pipelines, and offshore drilling operations can have a devastating effect on marine life, coating animals and plants in oil, which harms their ability to survive.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Causes of Water Pollution Section -->
    <section id="causes">
        <h2>Causes of Water Pollution</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Industrial Waste:</strong> Factories discharge untreated waste into rivers and oceans, releasing harmful chemicals, metals, and other toxins into the water.</li>
            <li><strong>Agricultural Runoff:</strong> The use of fertilizers and pesticides on crops leads to runoff during rains, which carries these chemicals into nearby rivers and lakes, contaminating the water.</li>
            <li><strong>Improper Waste Disposal:</strong> Dumping garbage, plastic, and other waste into water bodies results in contamination. Many urban areas lack proper waste management systems, leading to increased pollution.</li>
            <li><strong>Sewage and Wastewater:</strong> In many developing regions, untreated sewage is directly dumped into lakes and rivers, adding harmful bacteria, viruses, and nutrients that can lead to eutrophication.</li>
        </ol>

    <!-- Effects of Water Pollution Section -->
    <section id="effects">
        <h2>Effects of Water Pollution</h2>
        <p>Water pollution has severe effects on both the environment and human health. Here are some of the most damaging consequences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Harm to Aquatic Animals:</strong> Toxic chemicals and waste cause harm to fish, turtles, birds, and other aquatic animals, leading to death, disease, and the disruption of ecosystems.</li>
            <li><strong>Human Health Risks:</strong> Polluted water can carry diseases like cholera, dysentery, and typhoid, and can lead to long-term health problems such as cancer from exposure to carcinogens.</li>
            <li><strong>Loss of Biodiversity:</strong> As ecosystems are damaged by pollution, many species of animals and plants struggle to survive, causing a loss in biodiversity.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- How You Can Help Section -->
    <section id="how-to-help">
        <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
        <p>We all have a role to play in reducing water pollution. Here are a few steps you can take to help:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduce Plastic Usage:</strong> Avoid single-use plastic items like water bottles, straws, and bags. Instead, opt for reusable options.</li>
            <li><strong>Properly Dispose of Waste:</strong> Ensure that you dispose of waste in designated areas and recycle plastic, glass, and paper whenever possible. Never dump waste into rivers or oceans.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Eco-Friendly Products:</strong> Choose non-toxic cleaning products and organic pesticides for your home and garden to reduce harmful runoff.</li>
            <li><strong>Support Water Clean-Up Initiatives:</strong> Get involved with local organizations dedicated to cleaning water bodies and raising awareness about water pollution.</li>
