        <h2>Introduction to Aryabhata</h2>
        <p>Aryabhata was an ancient Indian mathematician and astronomer, born in 476 CE in Kusumapura (modern-day Patna). He is widely regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians and astronomers of the classical age. Aryabhata made significant contributions to mathematics, particularly in the fields of algebra, trigonometry, and number theory.</p>

        <h2>Key Contributions in Mathematics</h2>
        <ul class="contribution-list">
            <li><strong>Place Value System and Zero:</strong> Aryabhata is often credited with the introduction of the place value system, a concept that is fundamental to the modern number system. This system paved the way for the use of zero as a numeral, an essential element of mathematics today.</li>
          
            <li><strong>Pi (Ï€) Calculation:</strong> Aryabhata approximated the value of pi to be 3.1416, a remarkable degree of accuracy for his time. He also made a significant contribution to the understanding of the properties of circles.</li>
            <li><strong>Trigonometry:</strong> Aryabhata developed early trigonometric concepts, including the sine table and the use of sine in astronomical calculations. His work in this area contributed significantly to the development of trigonometry in later centuries.</li>
            <li><strong>Algebra:</strong> Aryabhata made advances in solving algebraic equations, including solutions to quadratic equations. His work on solving indeterminate equations laid the foundation for later developments in algebra.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Impact on Modern Mathematics</h2>
        <p>Aryabhata's contributions had a lasting impact on the development of mathematics, not only in India but also in the Islamic world and Europe. His work was translated into Arabic and influenced many renowned mathematicians, including Al-Khwarizmi, who helped spread these ideas across the globe. The use of zero, the place value system, and trigonometric advancements are all fundamental to modern mathematics and science.</p>
